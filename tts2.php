Nonetheless, at the tail end of last summer, a team of experts dug three trenches across the site and began hunting for evidence of the long-lost friary, where Richard III was recorded to have been buried.
The search turned up traces of the building, and then something altogether more exciting: A human skeleton, complete with evidence of battle wounds -- a blow to the head, and an arrow in the back -- and scoliosis, or curvature of the spine.
"I didn\'t think it was likely to be him at first," explains bioarchaeologist Jo Appleby, who excavated the remains. "The skull didn\'t seem to be in quite the right place -- now we know that\'s because of the scoliosis -- but it didn\'t seem to \'go\' with the legs.
"When I lifted the skull and saw the injury, a little alarm bell started to ring, but I told myself perhaps someone had dug into the grave at a later date and hit it with a spade, so I thought \'Don\'t say anything yet.\' "I cleared the arms and legs, and then went up the spine, hunting for vertebrae, [but] they weren\'t there, they weren\'t where I expected them to be. Instead they went in completely the wrong direction. At that point, I thought \'Hang on!\'"
"Someone came over and said \'I think you need to see this,\'" Buckley says. "We were looking at something else, so I said \'I\'m a bit busy at the moment,\' and they said \'No, no, you really need to see this.\'"
They were stunned to discover the remains were in surprisingly good condition - particularly given the fact they were apparently laid to rest in a simple shroud, with no coffin to protect them.
"There have been so many changes to the site over the years that the chances of finding the remains were so slim," says local historian David Baldwin. "It wouldn\'t have been at all surprising had they been destroyed."
As a shiver of anticipation spread across the site, one figure sat, deathly pale and shaking, at the side of the trench.
Philippa Langley had spent years trying to convince archaeologists and authorities alike to allow the dig for Richard III to go ahead. Now she watched, in shock, as the search she had championed for so long reached its climax.';
