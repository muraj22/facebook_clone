opticrop:
generates crops from a uniformly spaced grid of locations (and crop sizes), computes edgesum for each, picks highest one after normalization
inefficient bc many copies of image are made
time to run ~10-20s

opticrop 2:
finds center of edginess using weighted average -- systematic sum vs random sample: random is 10x faster

using gd is much faster than imagick for random pixel access

todo - crop around that center
